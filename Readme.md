# Students Exam Performance Predictor
## 📌 Project Overview

A data science project that predicts student exam performance based on factors like gender, ethnicity, parental education, lunch type, and test preparation courses. The goal is to derive insights into education outcomes and improve prediction accuracy using ML models.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Machine Learning Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.

EDA: Data cleaning, visualization, and feature engineering

Deployment: Virtual environments, Git/GitHub

## 🚀 Features

End-to-end data pipeline (cleaning → EDA → model training → evaluation)

Insightful visualizations highlighting factors affecting scores

Predictive models for student performance

## 🔮 Outcomes

Identified key factors influencing exam results

Built accurate ML models to predict student performance

Hands-on experience with full ML project workflow
